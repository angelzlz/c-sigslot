=========

Event-driven, universal asychronous/parallel infrastructure for C/C++, built on source level continuation and lock-free concurrency mechanism for C language.

Several language level facilities are afforded, which help a lot in writing asychronous and parallel code in imperative language, including closure, concurrent coroutine and the asychronous signal-slot mechanism.
